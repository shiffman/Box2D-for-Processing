# Box2D for Processing

A Processing library wrapping JBox2D (http://www.jbox2d.org/).

Download library: http://shiffman-archive.netlify.app/p5/libraries/box2d_processing/box2d_processing.zip

Tutorial and further examples for this library are available in The Nature of Code book: http://natureofcode.com. Note that there have been some changes to the library since the book was published; in particular you'll need to replace references to the `PBox2D` class with `Box2DProcessing`.
